Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then ? Operator Description Example + Adds two operands A + B will give 30 ? Subtracts second operand from the first A ? B will give -10 * Multiplies both operands A * B will give 200 / Divides numerator by denominator B / A will give 2 % Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer/float division B % A will give 0 ++ Increment operator increases integer value by one A++ will give 11 -- Decrement operator decreases integer value by one A-- will give 9 Previous Page Print Next Page   swift_operators.htm Advertisements Write for us FAQ's Helping Contact © Copyright 2017.
