For a for loop, the continue statement causes the conditional test and increments the portions of the loop to execute. For while and do...while loops, the continue statement causes the program control to pass to the conditional tests. Syntax The syntax for a continue statement in Swift is as follows ? 
continue
 Flow Diagram Example 
import Cocoa
 
var index = 10

do{
   index = index + 1
	
   if( index == 15 ){
      continue
   }
   println( "Value of index is \(index)")
}while index < 20 
 When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result ? 
Value of index is 11
Value of index is 12
Value of index is 13
Value of index is 14
Value of index is 16
Value of index is 17
Value of index is 18
Value of index is 19
Value of index is 20
