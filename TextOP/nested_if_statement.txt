Syntax The syntax for a nested if statement is as follows ? 
if boolean_expression_1 {
   /* Executes when the boolean expression 1 is true */
   if boolean_expression_2 {
      /* Executes when the boolean expression 2 is true */
   }
}
 You can nest else if...else in the similar way as you have nested if statement. Example 
import Cocoa

var varA:Int = 100;
var varB:Int = 200;

/* Check the boolean condition using if statement */
if varA == 100 {
   /* If condition is true then print the following */
   println("First condition is satisfied");
	
   if varB == 200 {
      /* If condition is true then print the following */
      println("Second condition is also satisfied");
   } 
}
println("Value of variable varA is \(varA)");
println("Value of variable varB is \(varB)");
 When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result ? 
First condition is satisfied
Second condition is also satisfied
Value of variable varA is 100
Value of variable varB is 200
