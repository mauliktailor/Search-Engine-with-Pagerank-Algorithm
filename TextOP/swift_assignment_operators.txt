Operator Description Example = Simple assignment operator, Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand C = A + B will assign value of A + B into C += Add AND assignment operator, It adds right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to left operand C += A is equivalent to C = C + A -= Subtract AND assignment operator, It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to left operand C -= A is equivalent to C = C - A *= Multiply AND assignment operator, It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to left operand C *= A is equivalent to C = C * A /= Divide AND assignment operator, It divides left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to left operand C /= A is equivalent to C = C / A %= Modulus AND assignment operator, It takes modulus using two operands and assigns the result to left operand C %= A is equivalent to C = C % A <<= Left shift AND assignment operator C <<= 2 is same as C = C << 2 >>= Right shift AND assignment operator C >>= 2 is same as C = C >> 2 &= Bitwise AND assignment operator C &= 2 is same as C = C & 2 ^= bitwise exclusive OR and assignment operator C ^= 2 is same as C = C ^ 2 |= bitwise inclusive OR and assignment operator C |= 2 is same as C = C | 2 Previous Page Print Next Page   swift_operators.htm Advertisements Write for us FAQ's Helping Contact © Copyright 2017.
